The daily changing technology have revolutionised the way we do shopping. When buying products
online we cannot physically experience the product and daily different brands are launching new
products. Therefore, the customers rely on the reviews written by other user to know the product
performance while considering the product. The customer cannot go through the entire text reviews so
he can rely on the average user rating and see how many verified buyers reviewed that to build his
confidence in the product and thatâ€™s why the reviews become so important for any e-commerce platform
and they need to provide best rated product to improve the customers experience on platform and retain
them.
During their decision-making process, consumers want to find useful reviews as quickly as possible by
rating system. Therefore, models able to predict the user rating from the text review are critically
important. Getting an overall sense of a textual review could in turn improve consumer experience.
To develop an automated system to analyse and monitor an enormous number of reviews. Analyse tone,
language, keywords and trend to provide valuable insight that increases the success rate of marketing
campaigns of new and existing products.
After treating the data, doing data processing and applying various ML algorithms, time-series NLP
models to get the insight from the data to help company grow the business.
The main goal for this project is to develop a model to predict user rating, usefulness of review and
recommend most similar items to users based on collaborative filtering
